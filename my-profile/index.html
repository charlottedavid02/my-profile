	 <h1>Hello, I'm Charlotte</h1>
      <img class="pierre" src="images/IMG_8485.jpeg" alt="Charlotte David" width="185" height="280">
      <p>I'm an 18 years old bi-national student at IESEG School of Management on the Paris campus. My principal interests are fashion since I was a child, and photography which is linked to traveling that is my third center of interest. I love traveling because it allows me to get to know many new cultures. I've traveled in Japan, Mexico, Tanzania, Thailand, The United States of America and many countries in Europe. I am now in a school of management since september 2020 that will help me create a great career path adapted to me.

     <h2>Fashionüß∂</h2>
     <p>
       Since I was a child I was attracted by the fact that every culture had its own style due to the differences of cultures. Moreover fashion is a remarkable way to express our own personality. These are the reasons why after my Bachelor in International Business I plan to attend a Master od Science in fashion management to build myself a carreer in this sector.

     <h2>Photographyüì∑</h2>
     <p>
     	Photography can be defined an alternative way to visit a location. With photography you observe every side and angle of a monument or a street for example to capture the best picture ever. Although photography allows to better conserve our best memories.

      <h2>Traveling‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
     <p>
     	Finally I'm passionate about traveling. Thnaks to my parents I've started traveling when I was young which allowded me to travel a lot in many countries that I previously mentioned. Furthermore I think that interacting with foreigners is a great way to become more open-minded.
